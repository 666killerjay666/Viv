# ChangeWindows viv
***viv*** is the fifth major version of ChangeWindows. Unlike previous versions, we're building this one out in the open. What's the ChangeWindows/ChangeWindows repository for? Well, that used to be version 5 too, but we just wanted to start anew.

I should remove that one at some point...

## FAQ

### What's gonna be new?

_viv_ isn't supposed to introduce any major new features at the start. It's mostly going to be just like ChangeWindows 4, but _fancy_. We will however finally have a proper account system, but that will be it for the time being. Although the means of management are going to change a lot with this one.

### What's a "_viv_"?

Nothing in particular. Just wanted to be cute and thus decided to go with a nice name. It mostly comes from the Dutch word "vijf" which means "five" in English. Why "five"? I think that's obvious.
