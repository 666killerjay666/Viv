<p class="lead">If you're reading this, you've found yourself on <i>viv</i>. What is this <i>viv</i>, you ask? Well... welcome to the next major version of ChangeWindows.</p>
<p>With <i>viv</i> we're going to do a few things differently. ChangeWindows will receive a new look with our primary goal set to making our website more accessible, easier to use and easier to navigate. Of course, what you're seeing now is only a <b>very early</b> preview of <i>viv</i>, so if you don't want that, feel free to return to <a href="https://changewindows.org">ChangeWindows 4.11</a>. Everything you're looking for is probably there.</p>
