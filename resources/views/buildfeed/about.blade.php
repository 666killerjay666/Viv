        <h4>*Gasp* Are you starting Bui-</h4>
        <p><b>No.</b> We are only hosting this data as an archive of the original <a href="https://buildfeed.net">BuildFeed</a>. We have no intend to continue expanding on it. Its only purpose here is for it to be readable online in a "not-a-12-MB-JSON-file"-way. This data is the BuildFeed data, unchanged, as it was. If you're looking for the latest and greatest buildstrings from internal builds from Microsoft (or public builds, for that matter), this is not the page you want to be on.</p>
        <h4>Are you planning usability improvements?</h4>
        <p>Yes, we have already made a limitted effor to make the BuildFeed data filter-able but we'll be doing more in future versions of ChangeWindows. At some point...</p>
        <h4>License</h4>
        <p>Note that the following license applies to the BuildFeed data and only the BuildFeed data. This license does not correspond with ChangeWindows or its data.</p>
